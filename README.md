# 🧬 Simulating Drug Resistance in Cancer Stem Cells using ML-Based Nanoparticle Optimization

This project explores how cancer stem cells (CSCs) respond to nanoparticle-based drug delivery using PhysiCell simulations. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to optimize nanoparticle properties to improve CSC targeting while minimizing drug usage.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Model tumor growth with CSCs and DCCs (differentiated cancer cells) in PhysiCell.
- Simulate nanoparticle drug delivery as a diffusible substrate.
- Use Python-based GA to optimize diffusion, decay rate, concentration, and potency of the drug.
- Maximize CSC & DCC kill while minimizing total drug used.
